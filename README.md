related to an EDA task

first split big data files into files with a maximum of 1000000 rows with Linux order
split -l 1000000 RB_DishwashWeekly_GB_fact_data_07072021.csv

 As a data privacy, I couldn't upload data to this repository.
 
 Consider that running EDA with whole data needs exclusive RAM hardware
 I have some problems with low capacity of RAM so I just calculated more correlation feature to others
